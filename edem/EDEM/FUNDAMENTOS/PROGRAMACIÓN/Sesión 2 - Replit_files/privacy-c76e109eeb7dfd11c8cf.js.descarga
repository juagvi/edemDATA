updated: 10/1/2021\n\nReplit, Inc. and its affiliates (\u201cReplit,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d and/or \u201cus\u201d) value the privacy of individuals who use our website and related services (collectively, our \u201cServices\u201d). This privacy policy (the \u201cPrivacy Policy\u201d) explains how we collect, use, and share information from or about you or your device as you use the Services. By using our Services, you agree to the collection, use, disclosure, and procedures this Privacy Policy describes. Beyond the Privacy Policy, your use of our Services is also subject to our [Terms of Service](https://repl.it/site/terms).\n\n**Information We Collect**\n\nWe may collect a variety of information from or about you or your devices from various sources, as described below.\n\nIf you do not provide your information when requested, you may not be able to use some or all of our Services if that information is necessary to provide you with our Services or if we are legally required to collect it.\n\n**A. Information You Provide to Us.**\n\n**Registration and Profile Information**. When you register for an account, we ask you for your      email address and may also request your phone number. If you sign up using a social media account, we will also receive information from those social media services such as your name, email address, and profile photo, in accordance with your privacy settings on those social media services. \n\n**Payment Information**. When you add a credit card or payment method to your account a third-party service provider that handles payments on our behalf will receive and process your payment card information.\n\n**Communications**. When you communicate with us, we may receive additional information about you. For example, when you communicate with our Customer Support Team, we will receive your name, email address, phone number, the contents of a message or attachments that you may send to us, and other information you choose to provide. If you subscribe to our newsletter, then we will collect certain information from you, such as your email address.      When we send you emails, we may use technologies such as web beacons to track whether you open them to learn how to deliver a better customer experience and improve our Services.\n\n**Careers.** If you apply for a job with us, you may submit your contact information and your resume online. We will collect the information you choose to provide on your resume, such as your education and employment experience. \n\n**B. Information We Collect Automatically When You Use Our Services.**\n\nWhen you use the Services, we use a variety of electronic tools, such as cookies, pixel tags, and similar technologies (collectively referred to in this Privacy Policy as \u201ccookies\u201d) to automatically generate information about how you use and interact with the Services as discussed in this section.\n\n**What are Cookies?  **Cookies are small files of letters and numbers that we store on your browser or the hard drive of your computer, or small graphic images placed on web pages or in emails. They can be stored either for a single browser session or more permanently.  We use cookies to collect information about your browsing activities, distinguish you from other users, provide functionality, and analyze use of the Services. Our third-party partners, such as analytics and advertising partners, may use these technologies to collect information about your online activities over time and across different services.  The types of cookies we and third parties may use to collect information are as follows:\n\n\n\n*   **Strictly necessary cookies.** Some cookies are strictly necessary to make the Services available to you. We cannot provide you with the Services without this type of cookies. \n*   **Functional cookies.** These are used to recognize you when you return to the Services. This enables us to adapt our content for you, and remember your preferences (for example, your choice of language or region).\n*   **Analytical or Performance cookies.** We also use cookies for analytics purposes in order to operate, maintain and improve our Services. We may use our own analytics cookies or use third party analytics providers such as Google Analytics to collect and process certain analytics data on our behalf. These providers may also collect information about your use of other websites, apps, and online resources. You can opt out of Google Analytics by installing Google\u2019s browser plug-in located [here](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).\n\nYou can find more information about your rights and choices, and how to block the use of certain cookies in the section Your Rights and Choices below.\n\n**What information do we automatically collect as you use the Services?**\n\n**Device Information**. We receive information about the device and software you use to access our Services, including internet protocol (IP) address, Internet Service Provider, web browser type, operating system version, phone carrier and manufacturer, application installations, device type and identifiers, and mobile advertising identifiers. \n\n**Location Information**. We may infer your general location information from other information we collect from and about you (for example, your IP address may indicate your general geographic region). \n\n**Usage Information**. To help us understand and analyze how you use our Services and to help us improve them, we automatically receive information about your interactions with our Services, like the pages or other content you view or interact with, the searches you conduct, your comments, any content you post, and the dates and times of your visits.\n\n**C. Information We Receive from Third Parties**. \n\n**Information from third party services. **If you choose to link our Services to a third-party account, we may receive information about you, including your profile information and your photo, and your use of the third-party account, in accordance with your settings on such third-party account. If you wish to limit the information available to us, you should visit the privacy settings of your third-party accounts to learn about your options.\n\n**Other third parties. **We may receive additional information about you, such as demographic data, from third parties such as data or marketing partners and combine it with other information we have about you. \n\n**How We Use the Information We Collect**\n\nWe use the information we collect:\n\n*   To provide, maintain, improve, and enhance our Services;\n*   To communicate with you, provide you with updates and other information relating to our Services, provide information that you request, respond to comments and questions, and otherwise provide customer support;\n*   To facilitate the connection of third-party services or applications, such as social networks;\n*   For marketing purposes, such as developing and providing promotional and advertising materials that may be useful, relevant, valuable or otherwise of interest to you;\n*   To personalize your experience on our Services such as presenting tailored content; \n*   To facilitate transactions and payments;\n*   To detect and prevent fraud, and respond to trust and safety issues that may arise; \n*   For compliance purposes, including enforcing our Terms of Service or other legal rights, or as may be required by applicable laws and regulations or requested by any judicial process or governmental agency; and\n*   For other purposes for which we provide specific notice at the time the information is collected.\n\n\n**De-Identified Information **. Please note that we may de-identify the information we collect from and about you so that it can no longer be reasonably linked to you or your device.  Once information has been de-identified in this way, we can use and share it for any purpose in our discretion, and this Privacy Policy no longer applies to such information. \n\n\n## **Legal Bases for Processing Information**\n\nVarious global privacy laws (such as those in the European Economic Area, United Kingdom, and Brazil) require that we have a \u201clegal basis\u201d to process your information.  The legal bases on which we rely to process your information include:\n\n\n\n*   **Consent.** You have consented to the use of your information, for example, where legally required, to send you marketing communications.\n*   **Contractual necessity.** We need your information to provide you with the Services, for example to facilitate your registration and respond to your inquiries.\n*   **Compliance with a legal obligation.** We have a legal obligation to use your information, for example to comply with tax and accounting obligations.\n*   **Legitimate interests.** We have a legitimate interest in using your information for a business purpose that does not override your individual rights and interests. For example, we have a legitimate interest in using your information for product development and internal analytics purposes, and otherwise to improve the safety, security, and performance of our Services. \n\n**How We Share the Information We Collect**\n\nWe share information with the following categories of third parties. \n\n**Affiliates. **We may share any information we receive with our corporate affiliates under common ownership or control for any of the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.\n\n**Service Providers. **We may share any information we receive with vendors retained in connection with the provision of our Services and that process your information on our behalf.  These entities may include analytics, billing, legal support, marketing, security, and fraud prevention companies. \n\n**Other Users and Individuals. **Our Services are social services in which you can find, collaborate on, and share content. Your profile, including your name, user name, profile picture, code, and other profile information (but not your email address or phone number) will always be viewable and searchable by other users and search indexed by online search engines. The content you post to the Services, including your code and forum posts, will be displayed on the Services and viewable by other users by default. The \u201cYour Preferences\u201d section of this Privacy Policy describes the controls that you can use to limit the sharing of your code. We are not responsible for the other users\u2019 use of available information, so you should carefully consider whether and what to post or how you identify yourself on the Services. Please note that student profiles created by teachers using Teams for Education and students\u2019 code are never publicly viewable or searchable, and students may not post content on publicly viewable forums.  \n\n**Third Party App Integrations.** If you connect a third-party application to our Services, we may share information such as code with that third party. \n\n**As Required by Law and Similar Disclosures. **We may access, preserve, and disclose your information if we believe in good faith that doing so is required or appropriate to: (a) comply with law enforcement requests and legal process, such as a court order or subpoenas; (b) respond to your requests; or (c) protect your, our, or others\u2019 rights, property, or safety.
